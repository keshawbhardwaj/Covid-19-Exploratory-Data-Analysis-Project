# Covid-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on Covid-19 data using Power BI. The data is sourced from Worldometer.com and is updated regularly. The primary goal of the project is to gain insights into the spread and impact of Covid-19 across various countries and regions.

The first step of the project involves loading the data from the web using Power BI's 'Get Data from Web' option. Once the data is loaded, the Power Query Editor is used to clean and transform the datasets. This includes removing null values, changing datatypes, and removing unwanted columns.

Next, the Visualization Pane in Power BI is used to create effective visualizations. Various types of charts such as area chart, pie chart, donut chart, stacked bar chart, and number card are used to represent the data in an easy-to-understand format. The visualizations are designed to highlight key trends and patterns in the data.

The project also involves creating interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data in more detail. The dashboards are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily filter and drill down into the data.

Overall, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the Covid-19 pandemic using Power BI's powerful data visualization and analysis capabilities. The insights gained from this project can help policymakers and healthcare professionals make informed decisions about how to combat the pandemic.
